# A Convolutional Neural Network for Classification of EEG Signals from SSVEP Responses of Migraine

A CNN model developed as a feature extractor and classifier for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for Migraine which may potentially be implemented in neurofeedback training or diagnostic protocol.

Note: This project is adapted from EEGNet architecture based on pytorch framework.
